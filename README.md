# Reactassessment5
Student is requested to create the example by themselves for both type of components
React Pure component and HOC


1) React.PureComponent is similar to React.Component. The difference between them is that React.Component doesnâ€™t implement shouldComponentUpdate(), but React.PureComponent implements it with a shallow prop and state comparison.
 2) a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
   const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
